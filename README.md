# Slidero

The only slider you'll ever need (just kidding) :sweat_smile:.

During my career I've seen many sliders and used many of them. One problem I had is that they either had tons of code, or they had complicated use.

So, this is my take on it.

I hope it will help at least one person.

If you have any question or ideas feel free to say so.

You can find simple example in index.html.
